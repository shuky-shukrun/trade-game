# Trade Game

**Trade Game** is an engaging trading simulation web application designed to demonstrate the capabilities of ChatGPT, specifically the GPT-4o model (paid version). The entire codebase was exclusively generated by GPT-4o, showcasing its potential to build interactive web applications from start to finish. This project was created as a fun and educational demonstration for my nephew.

The game challenges users to strategically manage their trades with a high chance of winning, while aiming to reach a goal of $1,000,000. It's a great way to understand basic trading concepts in a risk-free environment with an exciting twist.

## Features

- **Choose Your Starting Balance**: Begin the game with an initial balance of your choice, setting the stage for your trading journey.
- **High Probability of Winning**: Enjoy a 95% chance of winning each trade, with gains ranging from 6x to 11x the trade amount.
- **Manage Risks**: A 5% chance of losing a trade means losing the entire trade amount, emphasizing the importance of careful management.
- **Win or Bust**: The game ends when your balance reaches $1,000,000 (win) or if you lose all your money.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is fully responsive, working seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Detailed Trade Summary**: View a comprehensive table summarizing each trade, including trade count, starting balance, trade amount, outcome, win/loss amount, and new balance.
